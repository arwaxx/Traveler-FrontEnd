            <h2>What to do to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 </h2>
            <br>
            <P>Keep a distance of at least 1 meter from others to reduce the risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. </P> <p>Keep an even greater distance from others when indoors. The greater the distance, the better. </P> <br>
<P>Make it a habit to wear a mask when you are with other people. Proper use, preservation, cleaning </P> <p>and disposal of masks is essential to make them as effective as possible. </P> <br>
<P> Here is the basic information on how to wear a mask:</p>
  <p>  Clean your hands before putting on the mask, and before and after taking it off.</p>
    <p>Make sure it covers your nose, mouth and chin.<p>
  <p>  When you remove the mask, keep it in a clean plastic bag, and make sure to wash it daily if it is a cloth mask, or dispose of it in the waste bin if it is a medical mask.</p> <br>
  <p>  Do not use masks with valves.</P>
    <P>Avoid all three memes: enclosed, crowded, or close contact.</p> <br>
       <p> Outbreaks are reported in restaurants, choir rehearsals, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices, places of worship where people gather</p>,<p> and often in crowded enclosed spaces where people are loudly talking, yelling, breathing heavily or singing.
       </p> <p>The risk of contracting COVID-19 increases in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity to each other. It is these environments </p> <p> pin which the virus appears to spread more efficiently via respiratory droplets or aerosols, so precautions are more important.</P> <br>
        <P>Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings, especially if the indoor spaces are small and do not get outside air. </P> <br>
        <p>Forget the basics of good hygiene</p>

            <p>Regularly clean your hands thoroughly with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water. This removes germs, including viruses, that may be on your hands.</p><br>
           <p> Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. If hands become contaminated, the virus can be transmitted to the eyes, nose or mouth. </p> <p>The virus can enter your body through these ports and cause you to become ill. <br>
          <p>  Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow</p> <p>or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Then dispose of the tissue immediately in a closed trash can. By following good respiratory hygiene practices,</p>  <p>you protect the people around you from viruses such as the viruses that cause colds, influenza and COVID-19</p>. <br>
            Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, </p> <p>especially those that are touched regularly, such as door handles, faucets, and phone screens </p> <br>
