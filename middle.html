All these tombs were used to bury the kings and princes of the modern state in ancient Egypt, in addition to some nobles and those who were related to the ruling family at that time. The royal tombs are distinguished by their inscriptions and drawings from ancient Egyptian mythology illustrating the religious beliefs and memorial ceremonies of that time. And all the tombs discovered had been opened and looted in ancient times, and despite that remained irrefutable evidence of the strength and prosperity of the kings of that time.
